# 🏦 Loan Status Prediction

## 📖 Description

This project predicts whether a loan application is likely to be **approved or rejected** using machine learning models. It helps financial institutions make informed decisions by analyzing applicant data like income, credit history, loan amount, etc.

## ✨ Features

- Predicts loan approval status (Approved/Not Approved)
- Handles data preprocessing (missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Trained using logistic regression and other ML models
- Performance evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **NumPy**  
- **pandas**  
- **matplotlib**  
- **seaborn**  
- **scikit-learn**

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Loads and explores** the loan dataset.
2. **Cleans the data**: handles null values, encodes categorical variables.
3. **Performs EDA** to understand key trends.
4. **Splits data** into training and testing sets.
5. **Trains models** such as Logistic Regression and Decision Tree.
6. **Evaluates performance** and displays prediction results.
